# Privacy Policy

Rui's bot does not collect or store any personal or sensitive information. Only statistical information related to the usage of certain commands is recorded. For instance, the `/mine` command stores the user's score for the matching mini-game. To organize that data, Discord's unique user IDs and IDs from the relevant servers are used. Server configurations are also stored for the bot to work properly. 

The usage of the OpenAI API for ChatGPT requires access to message history to ensure conversation coherence. However, this data is not stored and it is simply passed to OpenAI via their API (Fully, i.e., their information storage policy).

Firestore from Google is used to store data related to Rui's bot. Please refer to their privacy policy for more information.

Your use of Rui's bot indicates your consent to the privacy policy.

This privacy policy may be updated from time to time without prior notification to reflect changes in our privacy practices. The new policy will be effective immediately upon posting of the changes.

For questions or concerns about Rui's Bot, you can contact us through Discord by sending a message to Banatawa#0069 or via email at contact@ruinformatique.ch. You can also visit our website at https://www.ruinformatique.ch.
